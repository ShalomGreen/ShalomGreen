- 👋 Hi, I’m @ShalomGreen
- 👀 I fell in love with front-end development after attending a SheCodes conference, played with excel, basics of sql for a bit then stumbled on the cloud 🌥. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html and CSS
- 💞️ I’m looking to enhance my skills via collaboration so-o, if you have any exciting project or you need an accountability partner, hit me👆 
- 📫 You can reach me at: shalombgreene@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: SHE/HER👩 
- ⚡ Fun fact: As a Public Health graduate, I thought I’d be saving lives—but right now, I’m just trying to save my code from breaking. Life is funny like that!
